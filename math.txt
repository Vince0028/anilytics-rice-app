Mathematical Formulas & Calculations for Rice Analysis 
1. Rice Demand Prediction Formula
Formula:
Demand = (Population × Average Consumption × Purchasing Power) ÷ (1 + Competitors)
Example:
•	- Population: 2,000 people
•	- Average Consumption: 2.5 kg/person/week
•	- Purchasing Power: 0.8 (80% capacity)
•	- Competitors: 3 vendors
Calculation:
Demand = (2,000 × 2.5 × 0.8) ÷ (1 + 3)
Demand = 4,000 ÷ 4
Demand = 1,000 kg/week

2. Waste Percentage Formula
Formula:
Waste % = (Unsold Rice ÷ Total Stock) × 100
Example:
•	- Rice Sold: 80 kg
•	- Rice Unsold: 20 kg
•	- Total Stock: 100 kg
Calculation:
Waste % = (20 ÷ 100) × 100
Waste % = 0.2 × 100
Waste % = 20%


3. Revenue Formula
Formula:
Total Revenue = Quantity Sold × Price per Unit
Example:
•	- Rice Sold: 80 kg
•	- Price per kg: ₱45
Calculation:
Revenue = 80 × ₱45
Revenue = ₱3,600

4. Linear Regression (Trend Analysis)
Formula:
m = [n∑(xy) - ∑x∑y] ÷ [n∑(x²) - (∑x)²]
Where:
- n = number of data points
- x = time period (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- y = values (sales, waste, etc.)
Example:
•	- data: Week 1: 100 kg, Week 2: 120 kg, Week 3: 140 kg
Calculation:
n = 3
x = [0, 1, 2]
y = [100, 120, 140]

∑x = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3
∑y = 100 + 120 + 140 = 360
∑xy = (0×100) + (1×120) + (2×140) = 0 + 120 + 280 = 400
∑x² = 0² + 1² + 2² = 0 + 1 + 4 = 5

m = [3(400) - 3(360)] ÷ [3(5) - 3²]
m = [1,200 - 1,080] ÷ [15 - 9]
m = 120 ÷ 6
m = 20 kg/week (increasing trend)
5. Moving Average Formula
Formula:
Moving Average = (Value₁ + Value₂ + Value₃) ÷ 3
Example:
•	- data: Week 1: 100 kg, Week 2: 120 kg, Week 3: 140 kg
Calculation:
Moving Average = (100 + 120 + 140) ÷ 3
Moving Average = 360 ÷ 3
Moving Average = 120 kg

6. Pearson Correlation Coefficient
Formula:
r = [n∑(xy) - ∑x∑y] ÷ √[(n∑x² - (∑x)²)(n∑y² - (∑y)²)]
Example:
•	- data: Price: [40, 45, 50] vs Sales: [100, 90, 80]
Calculation:
n = 3
x = [40, 45, 50] (prices)
y = [100, 90, 80] (sales)

∑x = 40 + 45 + 50 = 135
∑y = 100 + 90 + 80 = 270
∑xy = (40×100) + (45×90) + (50×80) = 4,000 + 4,050 + 4,000 = 12,050
∑x² = 40² + 45² + 50² = 1,600 + 2,025 + 2,500 = 6,125
∑y² = 100² + 90² + 80² = 10,000 + 8,100 + 6,400 = 24,500

r = [3(12,050) - 135(270)] ÷ √[(3(6,125) - 135²)(3(24,500) - 270²)]
r = [36,150 - 36,450] ÷ √[(18,375 - 18,225)(73,500 - 72,900)]
r = -300 ÷ √[(150)(600)]
r = -300 ÷ √90,000
r = -300 ÷ 300
r = -1.0 (Perfect negative correlation)

7. Forecasting Formula
Formula:
Future Value = Current Value + (Trend × Number of Periods)
Example:
•	- data: Current Sales = 140 kg
Sales Trend = +20 kg/week
Forecast Period = 4 weeks
Calculation:
Week 1: 140 + (20 × 1) = 160 kg
Week 2: 140 + (20 × 2) = 180 kg
Week 3: 140 + (20 × 3) = 200 kg
Week 4: 140 + (20 × 4) = 220 kg

8. Efficiency Score Calculation
Formula:
Efficiency Rating = {
    "Excellent" if Waste % < 10%
    "Good" if 10% ≤ Waste % < 20%
    "Needs Improvement" if Waste % ≥ 20%
}

9. Data Quality Score
Formula:
Quality Score = (Complete Records ÷ Total Records) × 100
Example:
•	- Total Records: 50
•	- Complete Records: 45
Calculation:
Quality Score = (45 ÷ 50) × 100
Quality Score = 0.9 × 100
Quality Score = 90%

10. Market Size Classification
Formula:
Market Size = {
    "Small" if Population < 1,000
    "Medium" if 1,000 ≤ Population < 2,000
    "Large" if Population ≥ 2,000
}

11. Seasonal Pattern Analysis
Formula:
Weekly Average = (Sum of Values for Day) ÷ (Number of Weeks)
Example:
•	- data: Monday sales over 4 weeks: [100, 120, 110, 130]
Calculation:
Monday Average = (100 + 120 + 110 + 130) ÷ 4
Monday Average = 460 ÷ 4
Monday Average = 115 kg

12. Price Elasticity Approximation
Formula:
Price Impact = (Current Price ÷ Average Price) × 100
Example:
•	- Current Price: ₱50
•	- Average Price: ₱45
Calculation:
Price Impact = (50 ÷ 45) × 100
Price Impact = 1.11 × 100
Price Impact = 111% (11% above average)
